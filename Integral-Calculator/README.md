# Integral-Calculator 
  The calculator takes as input an expression: f(x), that is evaluated using the postfix notation. The final result is rounded using the principle of Riemann sums.
  This project helped me understand floating-point numbers better.
  
  It also uses GNUPlot in order to show a graph of the calculated function.
    -> In order that GNUPlot will work, it must be installed. ( gnuplot folder contains all the package)
